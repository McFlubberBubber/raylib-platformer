TODO LIST
=========

- Always refactor for better architecture, but also get things working first.

- Title the game properly, complete missing main menu features.
- Figure out how to make opening menu + pause menu work with eachother. 

- Get some asset loading system to prepare for importing of character sprites / monster sprites /
  tiles, etc. (just make it work so we can put placeholders in).
- Once we get that sorted, find a good font to use throughout (should probably align with the
  artstyle-vision-thing we have for the game).
- If we do get a sense of direction for the artstyle, we can figure out what to do for the actual
  character sprites, tile map sprites, along with particle systems!

- Think about ways to improve collision detection rather than iterating through the entire array
  of tiles when in the game world. Maybe even switch to raycasting from the player to prevent
  flickering of states in the debug overlay.
- Figure out the camera system, maybe some levels want a fixed camera, some may want to scroll with
  the player, possibly figure out some smooth transitions between "screens" (like Celeste). 

- Think about how the world editor would work (I had an idea of making it similiar to the
  geometry dash editor, but minus all the triggers, but we could do something like that!).
- Figure out some way we can store the world data to represent it within the game. That way we
  have save the "levels" in some file format somewhere in the game's data folder, and read from that.

- We can get our hotloader functionality put into the game, along with some configuration file
  that gets read from / written to to save user config options.
