TODO LIST
=========

- Always refactor for better architecture, but also get things working first.

- Title the game properly, complete missing main menu features.
- Figure out how to make opening menu + pause menu work with eachother. 

- Get some asset loading system to prepare for importing of character sprites / monster sprites /
  tiles, etc. (just make it work so we can put placeholders in).
- Once we get that sorted, find a good font to use throughout (should probably align with the
  artstyle-vision-thing we have for the game).

- Get some sort of world drawn in-game that we can navigate in.
- Figure out collisions with the player and the environment to allow for actual platforming.

- Think about how the world editor would work (I had an idea of making it similiar to the
  geometry dash editor, but minus all the triggers, but we could do something like that!).
- Figure out some way we can store the world data to represent it within the game. That way we
  have save the "levels" in some file format somewhere in the game's data folder, and read from that.

- We can get our hotloader functionality put into the game, along with some configuration file
  that gets read from / written to to save user config options.
