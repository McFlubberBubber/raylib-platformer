TODO LIST
=========

- Always refactor for better architecture, but also get things working first.

- Title the game properly, complete missing main menu features.
- Figure out how to make opening menu + pause menu work with eachother. 

- Get some asset loading system to prepare for importing of character sprites / monster sprites / tiles, etc. (just make it work so we can put placeholders in).

- Get some sort of world drawn in-game that we can navigate in.
- Figure out collisions with the player and the environment to allow for actual platforming.
